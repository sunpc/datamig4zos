<h1>Process overview</h1>
<p>The tool supports to migrate both DB2 tables and datasets from one z/OS server to another, and runs a query in batch mode. </p>
<h2>Table migration process</h2>
<p>The table migration process includes unload, FTP, and load steps.</p>
<p>
	<li>Allocates a control library on both source and target servers.</li>
	<li>Submits an unload job to the source server to unload the data from the source table.</li>
	<li>Once the unload is done, submits an FTP job to the target server to transmit the unloaded dataset.</li>
	<li>Once the FTP is done, downloads the unload control card and use it to generate a load card.</li>
	<li>Uploads the load card to the target server.</li>
	<li>Once the upload is done, submits a load job to the target server to load the data into the target table.</li>
	<li>Once the load is done, the process is complete.</li>
</p>
<h2>Dataset migration process</h2>
<p>The dataset migration process includes an FTP step.</p>
<p>
	<li>Allocates a control library on both source and target servers.</li>
	<li>Submits an FTP job to the target server to transmit the dataset.</li>
	<li>Once the FTP is done, the process is complete.</li>
</p>
<h2>Database query process</h2>
<p>The database query process includes query and download steps.</p>
<p>
	<li>Allocates a control library on the source server.</li>
	<li>Submits a query job to the server to run the query.</li>
	<li>Once the query is done, downloads the query results.</li>
	<li>Displays the query results.</li>
