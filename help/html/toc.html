<p>Data Migration Tool for z/OS (DMTz) is a light-weight data migration tool to copy data from one z/OS server to another one. It submits JCL jobs to the servers, and supports both table and dataset migrations.</p>
<p>The project is built on Eclipse platform and uses the core libraries of edtftpj and hsqldb. The application is delivered as a standalone client running on Microsoft Windows.</p>
<h2>What is new in DMTz V6.3?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The system now retrieves the columns and table relationship info from SYSIBM tables along with the tables. The preload can then automatically determine the table relationship to ensure the parent tables are being migrated prior to the child tables.</li>
  <li>The Data Migration Request is upgraded with a clearer and more friendly user interface.</li>
  <li>A few enhancements to the UI and Help system are also included.</li>
</ol>
